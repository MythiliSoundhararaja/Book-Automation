# Automated Book Publication Workflow

This project builds an automated workflow for fetching book chapters from the web, rewriting them using AI, and managing versions with human review and ChromaDB integration. It is built using Docker, FastAPI, Playwright, and n8n for orchestrating the workflow.

## Features

- Scraping: Fetch chapter text and screenshot using Playwright
- AI Writing: Rewrite story using an LLM (e.g., Gemini)
- Human Review: Integrate manual approval via Notion and email
- Storage: Store final version in ChromaDB
- Search: Use a keyword to retrieve the best-matching rewritten story from ChromaDB
- Version Control: RL-style feedback loop with search consistency

git clone https://github.com/your-username/automated-book-workflow.git
cd automated-book-workflow
```

### 2. Run the Application

Ensure Docker is installed and running.

```bash
docker-compose up --build
```

This command will launch:

- FastAPI backend (scraper + ChromaDB interface) on port `8000`
- n8n workflow editor on port `5678`

## Access the Services

- **n8n Editor UI**: [http://localhost:5678](http://localhost:5678)
- **Scraping API**: `GET http://localhost:8000/scrape?url=<chapter_url>`
- **Screenshot**: `GET http://localhost:8000/screenshot`
- **ChromaDB Insertion**: `POST http://localhost:8000/add-to-chroma`
- **ChromaDB Search**: `GET http://localhost:8000/search?query=keyword`

## Notion & Email Integration

- Notion API is used to log rewritten content for manual human approval
- Email is sent with approval link using `Send Email` node in n8n
- Upon approval, content is POSTed to `/add-to-chroma`

---

## Environment Configuration

In `docker-compose.yml`, the following variables are set:

```yaml
N8N_DATABASE_TYPE=sqlite
N8N_BASIC_AUTH_ACTIVE=true
